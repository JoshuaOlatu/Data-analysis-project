# Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth supply chain data analysis of the beauty company "Glow and Flow" (Mock company & data) to evaluate how its sales have evolved post-COVID to date and opportunity to improve supply chain. The analysis investigates performance at multiple levels, including product lines, retailers, and regional distribution. By leveraging data visualization tools and SQL-based querying, the project offers actionable insights that enhances decision making in supply chain.

## Supply Chain Insights. This project aligns with supply chain objectives by providing detailed analysis and visualization to support decision-making, such as:

      Demand Planning: Analyze YoY sales trends to forecast future demand and optimize inventory allocation.

      Inventory Optimization: Identify fast- and slow-moving products by retailer and region to minimize overstock or stockouts.

      Retailer Collaboration: Measure retailer performance and identify opportunities for better alignment.

      Regional Strategy: Highlight regions with declining sales for strategic intervention or marketing efforts.

                                                             

# Detailed explanations of findings and insights. Here are a List of actionable insights that were drawn from this project

##  1. Understanding Post-COVID Demand Shifts
Consumer Behavior Changes: COVID-19 drastically changed how people shop, with increased demand for some products and declines in others . By analyzing our sales data, the supply chain team will now be able to identify which products or regions were impacted most and how demand has evolved since then. We can then take actions to maximize opportunity and reduce risks drastically

 Predict Future Demand:
Understanding historical sales trends will help forecast the future sales and adjust inventory levels accordingly.

## 2. Improving Supply Chain Efficiency
Inventory Management: Metrics like units sold and total sales helps to identify overstocked or understocked items, leading to better inventory planning and reduced carrying costs.
Regional Performance: Analyzing by region, state, and city highlights geographical trends. This will help the team optimize warehouse locations, shipping routes, and logistics to meet regional demand more efficiently.
Product-Level Insights: Looking at the product name and sales data will identify underperforming or overperforming SKUs, allowing for better production and distribution planning.

## 3. Cost and Profitability Analysis
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): Comparing total sales to COGS reveals profitability for each product, retailer, or region. If COGS for certain products has increased disproportionately, the supply chain team will investigate rising raw material, labor, or logistics costs.
Profit Margin Trends: Profit margins can indicate whether pricing strategies, production efficiencies, or supply chain optimizations are working. Post-COVID supply chain disruptions (e.g., higher freight costs) may have compressed margins, and this data can highlight opportunities to recover them.

## 4. Retailer and Customer Insights
Retailer Performance: Evaluating sales and profit margins by retailer helps identify high-performing partners or retailers that require attention due to lower sales or profitability.
Customer Trends: Insights into what products are selling well and where they are selling will help tailor supply chain strategies to meet customer preferences.

## 5. Risk and Opportunity Analysis
Risk Identification: Identifying regions or products with declining sales reveals risks such as weakening demand or increased competition.
Opportunities: Conversely, identifying high-demand regions or products enables the team to allocate resources strategically, such as increasing production or expanding capacity for popular items.
